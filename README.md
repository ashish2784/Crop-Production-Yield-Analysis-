# Crop Yield Analysis & Predictive Insights

## 🚀 Project Overview  
An interactive data analysis and visualization solution built using **Python** and **Tableau** to analyze agricultural data for actionable insights. The dataset contains over **20,000 rows and 10 columns** covering key agricultural metrics like **Rainfall, Fertilizer, Pesticide, Production, Yield, Area, Crop, State, Season, and Year**.

## ✅ Key Features  
- Data cleaning, outlier removal, and feature engineering.  
- Calculated fields:  
    - Production per Unit Area  
    - Year-over-Year Production Growth (%)  
- Interactive Tableau dashboard with:  
    - State-wise and Crop-wise performance comparison  
    - Correlation heatmaps  
    - Geographic production and rainfall visualization  
- Predictive model using **XGBoost Regressor** to estimate crop yield based on Rainfall, Fertilizer, Pesticide, and Area.

## 📊 Technologies Used  
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost)  
- Tableau

## 🎯 Outcome  
Provided key insights for optimizing input usage, improving crop yield, and making data-driven decisions for agricultural stakeholders.

## 📁 Dataset  
- Rows: 19,000+  
- Columns: 10 (Crop, State, Production, Yield, Rainfall, Fertilizer, Pesticide, Area, Season, Crop Year)
